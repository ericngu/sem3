## Chapter Notes

### Characterization of DS

#### What is a distributed system?

> "A system in which kardware or software components located at **networked** computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by **message passing**. - _Coulouris_

> "A distributed system is a collection of **independent** computers **that appear** to the users of the system as a single computer." - _Tanenbaum_

> "A distributed system is one on which I **cannot get any work done** because some machine I have **never heard** of has **crashed**." - _Leslie Lamport_

#### Why Distributed Systems?

| Reason                               | Examples                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### System Models

#### Physical Models

- **captures the _hardware composition_ of a system in terms of computer hardware and interconnecting networks.**
- model represents **underlying hardware** elements
- **abstracts away** from specific details of the computer and networking technologies employed.
- is the **baseline** physical model - how hardware or software components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their action by only passing messages.
- has 3 generations of distributed systems
  - Early distributed systems (1970s to early 1980s)
  - Internet-scale distributed systems
  - Contemporary distributed systems

| Distributed Systems | Early                                                    | Internet-scale                                               | Contemporary                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scale               | Small                                                    | Large                                                        | Ultra-large                                                  |
| Heterogeneity       | Limited (typically relatively homogenous configurations) | Significant in terms of platforms, languages, and middleware | Added dimensions introduced including radically different styles of architecture. |
| Openness            | Not a priority                                           | Significant priority with range of standards introduced      | Major research challenge with existing standards not yet able to embrace complex systems. |
| Quality of Service  | In its infancy                                           | Significant priority with range of services introduced       | Major research challenge with existing services not yet able to embrace complex systems. |

#### Architectural Models

- **discusses in terms of computational and communication tasks perform by its computational elements that are supported by appropriate network interconnections.**
- its structure in terms of separately **specified components** and their **interrelationships**
- major concerns are to make the system **reliable**, **manageable**, **adaptable**, **cost effective**
- three approaches:
  - looking at core underlying **architectural elements** that underpin modern Distributed Systems,
  - examining composite **architectural patterns** that are used in isolation or in combination with developing more sophisticated Distributed Systems, and
  - considering **middleware platforms** to support the various styles of programming.
- plenty of trade-offs associated with the choices identified in terms of architectural elements employed

##### Communication Entities

From system perspective:

- **Processes** are typically the communicating elements coupled with appropriate inter-process communication paradigms.
  - simpler environments such as sensor networks uses the term **nodes** in which OS processes are not supported.
  - most distributed environments have processes supplemented by threads, hence entities communicating in such systems are called **nodes**

From programming perspective, more **problem-oriented** abstraction have been proposed:

- **Objects** - OOP approaches in Distributed Systems
- **Components** - use emerged due to weaknesses in *objects*. Components resemble objects, key difference being components specify not only their *interfaces* but also **assumes other components/interfaces are present** for a component to fulfill its function
- **Web Services** - closely related to objects and components, it is integrated into the World Wide Web, using web standards. It can be viewed **as complete services in their own right**.

##### Communication Paradigms

Entities communicate in Distributed Systems via:

- **Inter-process Communication** - low-level support: message passing primitives, communication between processes, API to IP socket programming, multicast communication
- **Remote Invocation** - based on 2-way exchange between communicating entities, with results from calling remote operations, procedures, or methods. (**Request-reply protocol**, **RPC**, **RMI**)
- **Indirect Communication** - group communication, publish-subscribe system, message queues, tuple spaces, distributed shared memory.

| Communicating Entities              | Communication Paradigms               |
| ----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **System-oriented Entities**        | **Inter-process Communication**       |
| - Nodes, Processes                  | - Message Passing, Sockets, Multicast |
| **Problem-oriented Entities**       | **Remote Invocation**                 |
| - Objects, Components, Web Services | - Request-reply, RPC, RMI             |
|                                     | **Indirect Communication**            |
|                                     | - Group Communication, Pub-sub, DSM   |
|                                     | - Message Queues, Tuple spaces        |

##### Roles and Responsibilities

In a Distributed System, processes take on given roles and these roles are fundamental in establishing the overall architecture to be adopted.

Two architectural styles stemming from the role of individual processes:

- Client-Server
  - client processes interact with individual server processes in usually separate host computers to access shared resources. *(Eg, HTTP, FTP)*
- Peer-to-peer
  - all processes involved in a task or activity play similar roles, interacting cooperatively as peers without any distinction between client-server processes

##### Architecture Pattern

- is a pattern to build on more primitive architectural elements
- not necessarily complete on its on but offers partial insights, when combined with other patterns, helps the designer find a solution
- Key architectural patterns in Distributed Systems:
  - Layering
  - Tiered architecture
  - Thin clients
  - Middleware

##### Layering

- this approach **partitions a complex system into a number of layers** with a given layer making use of the services offered by the layer below.
- given layer offers **software abstraction**, with higher layers unaware of implementation detail
- in Distributed Systems term, it is equal to **vertical organization** of services into service layers.

![](C:\Users\ericn\Desktop\git\uni-notes\assets\net3204-01.jpg)

##### Tiered Architecture

- **complementary to layering**
- **tiering** is a technique to organize functionality of a given layer and place this functionality into appropriate servers and as a secondary consideration on to physical nodes
- commonly associated with the organization of application and services. *(Eg. presentation, business logic, data)*

![](C:\Users\ericn\Desktop\git\uni-notes\assets\net3204-02.jpg)

##### 2-tier architecture

- Advantages: Low Latency
- Disadvantages: application logic split across process boundary

![](C:\Users\ericn\Desktop\git\uni-notes\assets\net3204-03.jpg)

##### 3-tier architecture

- Advantages: 
  - app logic in one place - good for maintainability
  - each tier has well defined roles
- Disadvantages:
  - difficulty maintaining 3 servers
  - added network traffic and latency in operation

##### Thin Client

- refers to a software layer that supports window-based UI that is local to the user while executing application programs.
- generally for accessing services on a remote computer
- Advantages:
  - local device can be simpler
  - resource-constrained devices can be significantly enhanced with a plethora of networked services and capabilities
- Disadvantages:
  - network and OS latencies due to the highly interactive graphical nature of thin-client activities can reach unacceptable levels
- Examples: VNC, RealVNC, Remote Desktop, etc

#### Fundamental Model

- takes an abstract perspective to examine individual aspects of a distributed system. There are 3 important aspects

- **Interaction Model**
  - considers structure and sequencing of communication
- **Failure Models**
  - considers the ways how a system may fail to operate correctly
- **Security Models**
  - how the system is protected against attempts to interfere with proper operation
