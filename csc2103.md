## Revision Questions

### Example Paper 1

#### Question 1

1. Define the term algorithm and list the properties of algorithms.
2. Write a pseudo code that finds the biggest element of an array.
3. Demonstrate the actions of Shell Sort for the list of numbers given: `6, 56, 34, 23, 16, 4, 8, 1, 30, 41, 37, 52, 2`

#### Question 2

1. Describe briefly a method (algorithm) that makes use of stacks to construct __postfix__ expressions from a given __infix__ expression.
2. Construct a binary search tree to store the following list of alphabets. Draw the binary search tree that you have constructed. A final binary search tree is acceptable. `B E A U T I F U L`
3. Construct an AVL tree from the following sequence `42  8 27  36  40`. Show the important working steps.

#### Question 3

1.
