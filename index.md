# üéì Sunway University BSc (Hons) in Computer Science Notes üìù

Note: These notes are for 2017 January intakes. Syllabus will most likely have changed since then. Use at your own discretion, but I hold zero liability for your passing of your exams.

I have not made notes for many of the subjects, but hopefully for the ones I do have, that it'll help you in any way.

Enjoy! ‚ú®
