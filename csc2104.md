#### A. Threading

1. Describe the relationship between threads and processes.

2. If an application or function needs to be implemented as a set of related units of execution, why is it more efficient to do so as a collection of threads rather than a collection of separate processes?

#### B. Deadlock

1. Describe the **FOUR** conditions that must hold simultaneously for a deadlock to occur.

2. What is the difference between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance.

3. Given a set of active processes (P), a set of resources in a computer system (R), and a set of edges (E):

    `P = {P1, P2, P3}`

    `R = {R1, R2, R3, 2 x R4}`

    `E = {P1->R1,R4->P1,R3->P3,P3->R2,R2->P2,P2->R3,P3->R4}`

    If a resource can only be accessed by one process at a time, and a resource cannot be pre-empted, explain whether the computer system is in the deadlock state. You may assume that a process is in the running state if it is not requesting nor waiting for other resources.

#### C. Memory Management

1. Given **FIVE** memory partitions of 200 KB, 400 KB, 100 KB, 300 KB, and 700 KB (in order). How would each of the first-fit, next-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of 256 KB, 117 KB, 412 KB, and 226 KB (in order)?

2. Given **FIVE** memory partitions of 600 KB, 400 KB, 300 KB, 200 KB, and 100 KB (in order). How would each of the first-fit, next-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of 100 KB, 438 KB, 202 KB, and 337 KB (in order)?
