### Tutorial 4

#### A. Threading

1. Describe the relationship between threads and processes.

    A process, which has its own memory space, is like a container for the threads. The threads share that memory space and they are the units of execution within the process. Each thread has its own set of registers, stack, and program counter.

2. If an application or function needs to be implemented as a set of related units of execution, why is it more efficient to do so as a collection of threads rather than a collection of separate processes?

    - Takes less time to create new threads in an existing process than to create an brand new process.
    - Takes less time to switch between two threads within the same process (less information to save)
    - Threads sharing the same user address space allow communication to take place without intervention from the kernel.

#### B. Deadlock

1. Describe the **FOUR** conditions that must hold simultaneously for a deadlock to occur.

    - **Mutual Exclusion** - a resource can be accessed by only one process at a time.
    - **Hold and Wait** - a process is holding at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.
    - **No Preemption** - resources cannot be preempted. The resources can only be released voluntarily by the process that is currently holding it.
    - **Circular wait** - two or more processes form a circular waiting chain, where each process waits for a resource at the next process in the chain holds.

2. What is the difference between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance.

    - Deadlock prevention is to ensure that at least one of the four conditions required to form a deadlock can never happen. It does not dynamically examine the resource allocation and make use of additional information to avoid allocation that might eventually lead to deadlock.

3. Given a set of active processes (P), a set of resources in a computer system (R), and a set of edges (E):

    `P = {P1, P2, P3}`

    `R = {R1, R2, R3, 2 x R4}`

    `E = {P1->R1,R4->P1,R3->P3,P3->R2,R2->P2,P2->R3,P3->R4}`

    If a resource can only be accessed by one process at a time, and a resource cannot be preempted, explain whether the computer system is in the deadlock state. You may assume that a process is in the running state if it is not requesting nor waiting for other resources.

#### C. Memory Management

1. Given **FIVE** memory partitions of 200 KB, 400 KB, 100 KB, 300 KB, and 700 KB (in order). How would each of the first-fit, next-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of 256 KB, 117 KB, 412 KB, and 226 KB (in order)?

    | Partition \ Fit | First-Fit     | Next-Fit      | Best-Fit      | Worst-Fit     |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | 256 KB          | 400KB (114KB) | 400KB (144KB) | 300KB (44KB)  | 700KB (444KB) |
    | 117 KB          | 200KB (83KB)  | 144KB (27KB)  | 200KB (83KB)  | 444KB (327KB) |
    | 412 KB          | 700KB (288KB) | 700KB (288KB) | 700KB (288KB) | Wait          |
    | 226 KB          | 300KB (74KB)  | 288KB (62KB)  | 288KB (62KB)  | 400KB (174KB) |

2. Given **FIVE** memory partitions of 600 KB, 400 KB, 300 KB, 200 KB, and 100 KB (in order). How would each of the first-fit, next-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of 100 KB, 438 KB, 202 KB, and 337 KB (in order)?

    | Partition \ Fit | First-Fit     | Next-Fit      | Best-Fit      | Worst-Fit     |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | 100 KB          | 600KB (500KB) | 600KB (500KB) | 100KB (0KB)   | 600KB (500KB) |
    | 438 KB          | 500KB (62KB)  | 500KB (62KB)  | 600KB (162KB) | 500KB (62KB)  |
    | 202 KB          | 400KB (198KB) | 400KB (198KB) | 300KB (98KB)  | 400KB (198KB) |
    | 337 KB          | Wait          | Wait          | 400KB (63KB)  | Wait          |
