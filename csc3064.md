### Introduction to Distributed Systems

What is a distributed system?

> "A system in which kardware or software components located at **networked** computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by **message passing**. - *Coulouris*
>
> "A distributed system is a collection of **independent** computers **that appear** to the users of the system as a single computer." - *Tanenbaum*
>
> "A distributed system is one on which I **cannot get any work done** because some machine I have **never heard** of has **crashed**." - *Leslie Lamport*

### System Models

#### Physical Models

- captures the **hardware composition** of a system in terms of computer hardware and interconnecting networks.
- model represents **underlying hardware** elements.
- **abstracts away** from specific details of the computer and networking technologies employed.
- is the **baseline** physical model: how hardware or software components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their action by only passing messages.
- has 3 generations of distributed systems
  - Early distributed systems (1970s to early 1980s)
  - Internet-scale distributed systems
  - Contemporary distributed systems

#### Architectural Models

- discussions in terms of computational and communication tasks perform by its computational elements that are supported by appropriate network interconnections.

#### Fundamental Model

- takes an abstract perspective to examine individual aspects of a distributed system. There are 3 important aspects

- **Interaction Model**
  - considers structure and sequencing of communication
- **Failure Models**
  - considers the ways how a system may fail to operate correctly
- **Security Models**
  - how the system is protected against attempts to interfere with proper operation
