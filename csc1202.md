2. **Design the corresponding combinational circuits of the simplified forms in the previous question.**

3. **Differentiate between combinational and sequential circuits.**

    | Combinational Logic Circuits                                                                   | Sequential Logic Circuits                                                                             |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Output is a function of the present inputs (Time Independent Logic)                            | Output is a function of clock, present inputs and the previous states of the system.                  |
    | Do not have the ability to store data (state)                                                  | Have memory to store the present states that is sent as contro input (enable) for the next operation. |
    | It does not require any feedback. It simply outputs the input according to the logic designed. | It involves feedback from output to input that is stored in the memory for the next operation.        |
    | Used mainly for Arithmetic and Boolean operations                                              | Used for storing data                                                                                 |
    | Logic gates are elementary building blocks.                                                    | Flip flops (binary storage device) are the elementary building unit                                   |
    | Independent of clock and hence does not require triggering to operate.                         | Clocked (triggered for operation with electronic pulses)                                              |
    | Eg: Adder (1 + 0 = 1); Dependency only on present inputs ie. 1 and 0                           | Eg. Counter (Previous OP + 1 = Current OP); Depedency on present input as well as previous input.     |

2. **Explain the little-endianbyte ordering scheme.**

    Big Endian - most significant byte in smallest address

    | Address | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | 1000    | 90    |
    | 1001    | AB    |
    | 1002    | 12    |
    | 1003    | CD    |

    Little Endian - least significant byte in smallest address

    | Address | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | 1000    | CD    |
    | 1001    | 12    |
    | 1002    | AB    |

    - `ADD B` - Add contents of register B to accumulator.
    - `ADD a` - Look in memory at address `a` for operand.

2. **How is register addressing different from register indirect addressing?**
    - Register addressing refers to a register space, indirect addressing refers to a pointer in memory that points to an operand.

3. **How is indirect addressing similar to register indirect addressing?**
    - Indirect addressing and register indirect addressing both refers to a pointer to operand, only difference is the pointer in indirect addressing is stored in memory while the pointer in register indirect addressing is stored in the register.

    | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | Immediate         | Operand = A       | No memory reference | Limited operand magnitude  |
    | Direct            | EA = A            | Simple              | Limited address space      |
    | Indirect          | EA = (A)          | Large address space | Multiple memory references |
    | Register          | EA = R            | No memory reference | Limited address space      |
    | Register Indirect | EA = (R)          | Large address space | Extra memory reference     |

### RISC, Parallelism, Superscalar Concepts, Multicore Computer, GPUs and Industry Trends

#### Chapter 15

1. **Compare TWO key characteristics that can differentiate CISC and RISC.**

    | CISC                    | RISC                     |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
    | Less register space     | More register space      |

2. **How would you decide on the number of colours to be used for the graph colouring approach so as to optimize the number of real registers?**
    - Number of colors to equal the number of registers (slide 13)

3. **What is the objective of optimizing the instruction pipeline?**
    - To enhance performance by running the next instruction cycle's stage as soon as the previous one is done ie. running different stages of a different instrution cycle at the same time.

#### Chapter 16 - 19

1. **What is the advantage of a superscalar implementation?**
    - It allows parallel fetch & execute, enhancing performance.

2. **What is a superpipeline?**
    - Many pipeline stages need less than half a usual clock cycle to finish. A double internal clock speed allows TWO tasks per clock cycle on average, therefore doubling performance compared to regular operations. That is superpipeline.
    - As many pipeline stages need less than half a clock cycle to perform its tasks, superpipline is whereby a double internal clock speed is introduced to allow two tasks per clock cycle. (slide 7)

3. **Explain the concept of parallel processing.**
    - Breaking down large operations into smaller ones, then overlapping of them in parallel, running multiple instructions at the same time.

    - Two or more identical processors that have full access to all I/O devices.
    - Two or more identical processors that are controlled by a single OS that treats all processors equally.

5. **Discuss TWO performance issues that led to the development of multicore computers.**
    Hardware:
    - More complex processors requires more logic.
    - Increasing chip area for coordinating and signal transfer logic (harder to design, manufacture and debug)

    Software:
    - Increasing clock frequency causes heat issues and an exponential increase in energy requirements.

6. **Identify TWO popular applications that have successfully exploited multicore computers.**

| `POP X`       | Retrieves content from top of stack into register X                   | Pop from Stack               |
| `SPHL`        | Forces stack pointer to point to memory address stored in register HL | Stack Pointer to register HL |

### 8085 Status Registers/Flags

`S - Z - AC - P - C`

| Flag  | Name           | Function                                                                                           |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SF/S  | Sign bit       | works with C flag to show that result of operation is `0`                                          |
| Z     | Zero           | switched on if result of operation at Accumulator is `0`                                           |
| AC/AF | Auxilary carry | appears if a carry bit is used at 4th bit (exceeds 4 bits)                                         |
| P     | Parity         | appears if operation causes EVEN numbers of 1s in binary (Eg:  `1010`, `1100`, `1110 1000`)        |
| C     | carry          | appears if a carry is performed at 8th bit OR result is a 2's complement (only if `S = 1` as well) |

Notes: `SF = 1` , `C = 1` = negative operation result
