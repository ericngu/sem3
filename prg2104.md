## Object-Oriented Programming Terminology

### Terminologies

#### Class

  A class is a pattern or blueprint for creating an object. A class contains all *attributes and behaviors* that describe or make up the object.

#### Object

  An object is an instance of a class. It is a construct that combines a **state** (data) and **behavior** (operations). When combined, the state and the behavior represents an abstraction of a "real-world" object.

#### Instance

  An object created from a class (is an instance of of that *class*).

#### Constructor

  A special method that is called when creating a new object which initializes the object state.

#### Attributes

  Characteristics that describe the object (sometimes referred to as properties)

#### Methods

  Operations (or actions) that objects perform **or** operations which are performed to an object. Sometimes referred to as behaviors.

#### Encapsulation

  Refers to the combining of an object's *attributes and behaviors* into a single package, i.e. a *class*. The programmer then can then access the methods and properties of the class without having to understand the implementation.

#### Inheritance

  Refers to the capability of creating a new *class* from an existing class.

#### Parameter

  A special kind of variable passed to a subroutine/procedure/function call i.e in `def add_two(number_1, number_2)`, `number_1` and `number_2` are parameters in the function.

#### Argument

  Values supplied to the subroutine/procedure when it is called i.e in `def add_two(number_1, number_2)`, when calling `add_two()`, you would enter `add_two(2,6)` and thus `2` and `6` are arguments in the function call.

#### Behavior

  Tasks and actions that are performed by the object.

#### Characteristic

  Properties, qualities, or states, of an object.

#### Variable

  An identifier in the program that stores values or reference(s) that are mutable.

#### Constant Variable

  Immutable variables - variables that cannot be changed after being declared.

#### Instance Variable

  A non-static *field* of a *class*. Each individual object of a class has its own copy of such a field. This is in contrast to a *class variable* which is shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are used to model the *attributes* of a class.

#### Instance Method

#### Static Variable/Class Variable

  A variable defined inside a *class body*. Such a variable belongs to the class as a whole, and is, therefore, shared by all objects of the class.

#### Predefined Library

#### User Defined Library

#### Type

#### Generalization

#### Specialization

#### Inheritance for Specialization

#### Singleton Object

#### Companion Object

#### Method Signatures

  A method signature is part of the method declaration. It is the combination of the method name and the parameter list.

#### Overriding

  A method defined in a *super class* may be overridden by a method of the same name defined in a *sub class*. The new method with the same name will have a different output/signature.

#### Abstract Class

  A class with the *abstract* reserved word in its header. Abstract classes are distinguished by the fact that you may not *directly* construct objects from them using the *new* operator. An abstract class may have zero or more *abstract* methods.

#### Concrete Class

#### Polymorphism

  Polymorphism refers to the capability of having methods with the same names and parameter types exhibit different behavior depending on the receiver. In other words, you can send the same message to two different objects and they can respond in different ways.

#### Overloading

  Using the same names to mean different things in different contexts. A method with the same name/identifier but produces different results.

#### Parametric Polymorphism

  A function or data type that is written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on its type.

  ```Java
  public static <T> void sort(T[] a, Comparator<? super T> c) {
   ...
  }
  ```

#### Subtype Polymorphism

  Allows a function to be written to take an object of a certain type, but also works correctly if passed an object that belongs to a different type, that is a subtype of the original type.

  ```Java
  Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(runnable);
  ```

#### Cohesion

  A measure of how focused the tasks of a module is. The extent to which a component performs a single well-defined task.

#### Coupling

  The dependencies of modules on each other. When classes are aware of each other because their instances must interact.

#### Interface

  When a *class* implements an interface, the class inherits no implementation from the interface, only method signatures and *static variables*.

#### Trait



#### Generic Programming

#### Iterator

#### Data Field

#### Property

#### Mixin

#### Instantiation

  The creation of an *instance* of a class - that is an *object*.

#### Initialization

#### Aggregation

#### Composition

#### Identifier

#### Has-A Relationship

#### Is-A Relationship
