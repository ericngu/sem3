## Object-Oriented Programming Terminology

### Terminologies

#### Class

  A class is a pattern or blueprint for creating an object. A class contains all *attributes and behaviors* that describe or make up the object.

#### Object

  An object is an instance of a class. It is a construct that combines a **state** (data) and **behavior** (operations). When combined, the state and the behavior represents an abstraction of a "real-world" object.

#### Instance

  An object created from a class (is an instance of of that *class*).

#### Constructor

  A special method that is called when creating a new object which initializes the object state.

#### Attributes

  Characteristics that describe the object (sometimes referred to as properties)

#### Methods

  Operations (or actions) that objects perform **or** operations which are performed to an object. Sometimes referred to as behaviors. A collection of statements that, when run together, performs a task.

#### Encapsulation

  Refers to the combining of an object's *attributes and behaviors* into a single package, i.e. a *class*. The programmer then can then access the methods and properties of the class without having to understand the implementation.

#### Parameter

  A special kind of variable passed to a subroutine/procedure/function call i.e in `def add_num(num1, num2)`, `num1` and `num2` are parameters in the function.

#### Argument

  Values supplied to the subroutine/procedure when it is called i.e in `def add_num(num1, num2)`, when calling `add_num()`, you would enter `add_num(2,6)` and thus `2` and `6` are arguments in the function call.

#### Behavior

  Tasks and actions that are performed by the object.

#### Characteristic

  Properties, qualities, or states, of an object.

#### Variable

  An identifier in the program that stores values or reference(s) that are mutable.

#### Constant Variable

  Immutable variables - variables that cannot be changed after being declared and assigned.

#### Instance Variable

  A non-static *field* of a *class*. Each individual object of a class has its own copy of such a field. This is in contrast to a *class variable* which is shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are used to model the *attributes* of a class.

#### Instance Method

  A subroutine of an object.

#### Static Variable/Class Variable

  A variable defined inside a *class body*. Such a variable belongs to the class as a whole, and is, therefore, shared by all objects of the class.

#### Predefined Library

  A library of high-quality classes and methods that is shipped with compilers by default that provides solutions to common problems.

#### User Defined Library

  A library of classes and methods that are written by the programmer themselves for more specific problems.

#### Type

  A set of data values, as well as

#### Generalization

  The process of avoiding code and data duplication among several classes by creating a super class to those classes and moving the duplicate code and data up into that superclass, which is commonly abstract.

#### Specialization

  The process of extending an existing class by adding new features is called using inheritance for specialization.

#### Singleton Object

  An object that has only one instance in the entire program and is defined using the `object` keyword.

#### Companion Object

  A singleton object that has the same name with a class name, and it is used to describe every instance of the class.

#### Method Signatures

  A method signature is part of the method declaration. It is the combination of the method name and the parameter list.

#### Overriding

  A method defined in a *super class* may be overridden by a method of the same name defined in a *sub class*. The new method with the same name will have a different output/signature.

#### Abstract Class

  A class with the *abstract* reserved word in its header. Abstract classes are distinguished by the fact that you may not *directly* construct objects from them using the *new* operator. An abstract class may have zero or more *abstract* methods.

#### Concrete Class

  A class that can have instances.

#### Polymorphism

  Polymorphism refers to the capability of having methods with the same names and parameter types exhibit different behavior depending on the receiver. In other words, you can send the same message to two different objects and they can respond in different ways.

#### Overloading

  Using the same names to mean different things in different contexts. A method with the same name/identifier but produces different results.

#### Parametric Polymorphism

  A function or data type that is written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on its type.

  ```Java
  public static <T> void sort(T[] a, Comparator<? super T> c) {
   ...
  }
  ```

#### Subtype Polymorphism

  Allows a function to be written to take an object of a certain type, but also works correctly if passed an object that belongs to a different type, that is a subtype of the original type.

  ```Java
  Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(runnable);
  ```

#### Cohesion

  A measure of how focused the tasks of a module is. The extent to which a component performs a single well-defined task.

#### Coupling

  The dependencies of modules on each other. When classes are aware of each other because their instances must interact.

#### Interface

  When a *class* implements an interface, the class inherits no implementation from the interface, only method signatures and *static variables*.

#### Trait

  Used to share interfaces and fields between classes. They are similar to Java 8's interfaces.

#### Generic Programming

  Allows types to be parameterized in classes, interfaces, or methods, much like formal parameter use in method declaration.

#### Iterator

  An interface for collection in Java/Scala library that specifies `hasNext` and `next` abstract function.

#### Data Field

  Represents the attribute of an object.

#### Property

  A method in OOP to expose private data field through getter and setter so that data can be encapsulated in within the class to hide internal data field handling and also allow implementation of data validation.

#### Mixin

  A class that contains implementation for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.

#### Instantiation

  The creation of an *instance* of a class - that is an *object*. The creation of an object from a class.

#### Initialization

  Assigning values to an object's attributes, assigning the first value to a variable.

#### Aggregation

  A relationship in which an object contains one or mre other subordinate objects as part of its state. The subordinate objects typically have no independent existence separate from their containing object. For example, a gas station object might contain several pump objects. These pumps will only exist as long as the station does. It is also referred to as the *has-a relationship*.

#### Inheritance

  Refers to the capability of creating a new *class* from an existing class. The new *inherited* class contains all methods, variables, and other attributes from the *parent class*. Also known as a *is-a relationship*.

#### Composition

  A strict form of aggregation where the life of the part is tied to the life of the whole.

#### Identifier

  A programmer-defined name for a *variable*, *method*, *class*, or *interface*.

#### Has-A Relationship

  Also known as *aggregation*.

#### Is-A Relationship

  Also known as *inheritance*.
